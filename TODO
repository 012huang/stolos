- in tasks.json, make missing job_id identifiers just assume we depend on all of them.
  - dag_tools tests for this
- make job_id_validations file optional.  raise error if it's not a python path
  - consider util.load_... use a filepath instead of a python path?
  - need to modify dag_tools code
- remove qbcli.create.   set vs create is not a necessary distinction.

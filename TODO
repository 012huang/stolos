- python 3 compatible
- tests: put inside Docker container.
- maybe make job_id_validations file optional?  raise better error if it's not a python path
  - consider util.load_... use a filepath instead of a python path?
  - need to modify dag_tools code
- remove qbcli.create.   set vs create is not a necessary distinction.
